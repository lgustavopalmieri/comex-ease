### NCM ###

The NCM, or Mercosur Common Nomenclature (Nomenclatura Comum do Mercosul in Portuguese),
is a system for classifying goods used in international trade. 
In Brazil, it is equivalent to the code of the Combined Nomenclature (CN) 
used in the European Union. The NCM is a specific table that assigns a code 
to each type of commodity for the purposes of import and export.

It is essential for the identification and control of goods in international 
transactions, facilitating communication between the various countries involved. 
The NCM is used to determine customs tariffs, rules of origin, and other trade 
regulations.
